Revision history for PHP class FedExDC

----		14.March.2007 (Greg Perkins)
			- Changed service type names in $FE_ST
			- Added service types for international shipping ($FE_ST_INTL)
			- Changed the function service_type to handle domestic and international service types

1.02    08/29/2005
        - Added PEAR HTTP_Request functionality.  You need PEAR HTTP_Request 
          (http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.http.http-request.php) installed 
          and PHP compiled with SSL support.
        - New strict_tag option.  Set this to false if you do not want to look up
          tag names in the fedex-tags ($FE_RE) array. By default this is set to true.
        - New transaction types and names.  FedEx has changed many of the methods
          available through their DC API.  As a result, I have changed many of the names 
          of the transaction methods.  If you are upgrading from 1.01 you can still use the old method names,
          but please try to use the newer names going forward.  Also, make sure to download the latest
          FedEx TagTransGuide.pdf from FedEx's website.
        - Included a few more example scripts (address_validate.php, rate_services.php)
        - Looking for support?  We have a new mailing list for this project!

1.01    08/11/2004
        - Many new features.
        - Added FedEx code lookup table.  A mapping of all possible FedEx's tags.
          You can now pass the field name from the array $FE_RE in the fedex-tags class.
        - Better error checking on data parsing/splitting
        - Per FedEx request I will no longer include the addresses to FedEx's API servers (FEDEX_URI)
